<p>Rating Stone is currently down for maintenance (running MYSCRIPT).
<p>The process was started at MYDATE;
it currently should take a minute or two (longer when we have more users!).
<P>We'll refresh this page every 20 seconds to keep you updated,
or <a href="/">click here</a>.  Feel free to
<a href="mailto:agmsrepsys@gmail.com">write to the webmaster</a> if it seems to
be down too long.
