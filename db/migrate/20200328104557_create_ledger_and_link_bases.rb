      t.references :original, null: true, foreign_key: {to_table: :ledger_bases, name: "fk_rails_ledgeroriginal"}, comment: "Points to the original version of this record, or equal to id if this is the original one.  NULL if not initialised (should be a copy of the id of this record)."
      t.references :amended, null: true, foreign_key: {to_table: :ledger_bases, name: "fk_rails_ledgeramended"}, comment: "Points to the latest version of this record, or NULL if this is not the original record."

      t.boolean :has_owners, default: false, comment: "True if there is one or more LinkOwner records (even deleted ones) that references this record.  False if there are none, which means we can skip searching for LinkOwner records every time we check permissions, which saves a lot of database queries!"
      t.boolean :is_latest_version, default: true, comment: "True if the record is the latest version of the object.  False otherwise.  Caches the result of looking up the original object and seeing which record is the latest, so we have less overhead when displaying only the latest versions in a list of posts.  Also lets us skip older versions directly in an SQL query."

      t.integer :current_ceremony, default: -1, comment: "The number of the awards ceremony that the current points were calculated for.  0 means before the first ceremony.  Set to -1 to force a recalculation of current points.  If it is less than the most recent ceremony's number, the points just need an update recalculation."
      t.integer :original_ceremony, default: -1, comment: "The number of the awards ceremony immediately prior to the creation of this object.  0 if before the first awards ceremony.  Negative is an initialisation bug.  Theoretically you could figure it out from the record creation date."
