  <h1>Welcome to the Rating Stone Reputation System</h1>

  <h2>
    This is a social media experimental prototype where spending rating points
    can affect the reputation of a post, or even a user.
  </h2>

  <p>
    It's less evil than the stereotypical reputation system since it has
    forgiveness (things fade away over time) and a weekly allowance to make
    people think twice before making a rating.  There's also an economy where
    the points you use for <I>liking</I> someone can be spent by them or kept
    for improving their reputation.

  <p>
    Currently the web site is being created, so any changes you make will
    likely disappear the next time I rearrange the database.  Feel free to
    poke around and try things out.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.
