<h1>Numerical Word Counter</h1>

<p>Paste your script into the box, select the word expansion options you want, and press the Update Count button to do the count.  It also updates the expanded version of your script.  If you wish to, edit the script and repeat as needed.

<%= form_with do %>
  <p>some stuff</p>
<% end %>

<p><small>Situation, legal and otherwise: You don't need to log in to do a word count, though that may be required later if we ever finish the rest of this less evil social media web site.  Since you aren't logging in, you don't need cookies (they're only used for identifying logged in people).  Every web page access is logged, though the logs are discarded whenever the web server is rebooted (typically weekly).  The server sees you script, but it isn't logged or stored, just processed and shown back to you.  Use of this experimental web site is at your own risk and expense; we don't guarantee anything.</small></p>
